For this project we will be sourcing data about Theme Parks worldwide from The Park Database website: https://www.theparkdb.com/

We will be looking at three specific metrics
1. Adult Ticket Price
2. Crowded = people per square meter
3. Size = square meters

Project tasks:
1. Pull all three metrics for every theme park in every country included on this website
2. Convert the ticket prices into US dollars using currency exchange rates
3. Rank theme parks worldwide and within the USA for ticket price ($)
    Worldwide ranking = all theme parks worldwide ranked from highest to lowest adult ticket
price
    USA ranking = all theme parks worldwide ranked from highest to lowest adult ticket price.
4. Rank theme parks worldwide and within the USA for people per square meter
5. Rank theme parks worldwide and within the USA for size (square meters)
6. Organise the data into the following tabs on Google sheets (name tabs with the titles in bold)
  • Worldwide - Crowded: isolate the 20 theme parks worldwide with the most people per
square meter. Provide columns for rank (1-20), theme park name, country, location, brand

  • Worldwide - Expensive: isolate the 20 theme parks worldwide with the highest adult ticket
price. Provide columns for rank (1-20), theme park name, country, location, brand and adult

meters. Provide columns for rank (1-10), theme park name, country, location, brand and size
