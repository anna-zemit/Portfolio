Project Task:
Create 2 parsers for 2 URLs with a cartoon movie script scenario.
Each parser should output a table indicating which character says what (line by line). 
Incomprehensible text (including text within parentheses) should be ignored.
Each parser should be implemented as a function that takes a URL argument (as a string) and returns a pandas.DataFrame with two columns: ['Character', 'Speech'].
