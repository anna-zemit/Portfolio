Project Task List:

1. Task: Parse auto.ru website to collect data about used cars in Moscow
   - Develop a web scraping script to extract data from the auto.ru website
   - Test the script to ensure accurate and reliable data extraction
   - Implement error handling and exception management in the script
   - Schedule the script to run at regular intervals to gather updated data

2. Task: Create a machine learning model to predict the cost of a car based on its characteristics
   - Gather and preprocess the collected car data from the previous task
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset
   - Select and engineer relevant features that may affect the car's price
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm 
   - Train the machine learning model using the training dataset
   - Evaluate the model's performance using mape metri—Å
   - Validate the model's performance using the testing dataset

3. Task: Documentation and Reporting
   - Document the entire data collection process, including the web scraping script and its usage instructions
   - Document the feature engineering techniques and data preprocessing steps
   - Document the chosen machine learning algorithm
   - Document the model evaluation results
