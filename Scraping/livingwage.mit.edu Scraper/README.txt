The aim of this project was to determine how much more women need to earn to comfortably retire in every state 
and how many more years women have to work to comfortably retire in every state.

To complete the project we used the following approach:

1) We started by taking the average retirement age of 64 and obtained the most recent life expectancies for each gender 
in each state from Wikipedia. 
We sourced the cost of living in each state from MIT's Living Wage Calculator (https://livingwage.mit.edu). 
To estimate the cost of a more comfortable retirement, we multiplied this annual figure for each state by 20%.

2) We calculated the difference in years between the retirement age and life expectancy for each gender in each state. 
Next, we calculated the savings needed to retire for both genders in each state by multiplying the annual income requirement 
by the number of years in retirement. We then determined how much more women would need to save in each state.

3) We pulled the median earnings for men and women in each state from the U.S. Census Bureau (https://data.census.gov). 
We subtracted the cost of living for each state from each genderâ€™s median earnings to calculate the estimated yearly savings 
for each gender in each state.

4) Finally, we calculated how many years each gender would need to work to save for a comfortable retirement 
and ranked the data accordingly.

The data was collected in September 2024.
