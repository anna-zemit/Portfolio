The aim of this project is to find out which cities have the most competitive job markets.

To complete this project we calculated the average (mean) number of applicants that a job advert receives within one week 
of being posted on LinkedIn Jobs.

We considered ‘in-office’ or ‘hybrid working’ job adverts recently posted in any industry within 130 cities and every US State. 
The seed list of cities included the 20 most populated cities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, 
plus an additional 50 cities from around the world that have been highlighted in previous news articles for having a large number 
of job postings.

For cities to appear in our final rankings, they needed to have included a minimum of 100 job postings available to apply for, 
which had been posted no longer than seven days before the data was retrieved.

The data was collected in June 2024.
