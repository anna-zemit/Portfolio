The aim of this project was to identify the Global and American Cities With the Driest Air.

To complete the project we scraped humidity data for major locations in each country and US state from the website https://weatherspark.com/.

Data were collected for 14,657 cities around the world and 5,175 US cities. 
Next, we calculated the percentage of the year that is "dry," converted percentages into "dry days," and ranked the data.

Please note that the information provided is accurate as of February 2024.
