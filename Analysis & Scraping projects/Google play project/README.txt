The aim of this project was to determine the email, messaging, and social media apps with the highest and lowest ratings 
in every country on the Google Play store.

To complete the project we began by compiling a seed list of the top communications and social media apps for each country. 
To do this, we pulled the top 50 communications and social media apps for each country from the www.similarweb.com website. 
Our seed list included 714 unique communication apps and 779 social media apps.

Next, we retrieved the rating breakdown for the top 50 apps in every country from Google Play. Using the star rating breakdowns, 
we calculated the scores out of five and ranked the data accordingly.

Please note that the information provided is accurate as of May 2024.
