The aim of this project was to find out the American cities with the highest average rating for their independent 
shopping stores overall and for select categories, as well as the highest rated independent stores across all cities. 

To complete this project we pulled all pages of stores under the “boutique shopping” filter in the 100 most populated 
US cities from the Yelp.com website. On the store pages, we recorded the store categories, star ratings, and number of reviews.

Initially, our dataset included 8,386 boutiques across the US.

After pulling the data, we calculated the weighted average rating for boutique stores in each city based on the 
individual store ratings and number of reviews. Additionally, we calculated the weighted average rating for each 
selected category of boutique store in each city. Next, we isolated the highest rated stores overall and for selected 
categories and ranked the data.

The data was collected in July 2024.

The results of this research, along with visualizations, are presented on the following webpage:
