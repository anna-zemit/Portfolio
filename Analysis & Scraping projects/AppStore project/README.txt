The aim of this project is to determine the personal finance apps that collect the most personal data from users.

To complete the project we analysed the privacy permissions of 204 apps listed in the iOS App Store in the following categories: 
Buy Now, Pay Later; Online Banking Apps; Budgeting & Money Management; Stock Trading & Investing; Cash Back Apps; 
Coupon Apps and Money Transfer Apps. 

Personal finance apps were ranked based on the number of personal data segments users must consent to in their privacy agreements. 
Only apps with at least 5,000 user reviews were considered. Personal data segments were standardised across apps to include a maximum 
of 30 possible data points, bucketed across 14 broad categories of data type. 
Personal finance apps with the same number of personal data segments collected were ranked higher if they had a higher number of 
user reviews.

Data for this research was collected and analysed in September 2023.

The results of this research, along with visualizations, are presented on the following webpage:
