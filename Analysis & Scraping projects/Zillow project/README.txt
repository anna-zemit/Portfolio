The aim of this project is to identify the rental options available in U.S. cities with the median graduate salary.

To complete this project we focus on the 100 most populated U.S. cities along with the 5 most populated cities from each U.S. state.

First, we extract graduate salary data from the US Census at https://data.census.gov. 
Specifically, we retrieve the figures for median earnings from individuals with a Bachelor’s Degree in the past 12 months.

Next, we calculate 30% of the average annual salary for each city and divide this by 12 to obtain 30% of the monthly salary.

Afterward, we scrape the number of rental listings available on zillow.com for each city and also retrieve the count of rentals 
listed within the maximum 30% salary price. For each rental listing obtained from this search, we gather data on its price 
and size in square feet. In total, data on 54,327 properties was scraped.

Finally, we rank all cities based on the percentage of rentals listed at 30% or less of the city’s average monthly salary. 
Additionally, we rank all cities by the average square footage of a property that can be rented for 30% of the local area’s 
average monthly salary.
