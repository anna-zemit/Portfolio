The aim of this project was to identify the American cities with the highest-rated independent coffee shops 
and the top-rated independent coffee shops nationwide and by state. 

To complete the project we followed the approach outlined below:

First, we pulled ratings and review counts for all coffee shops in every US city on TripAdvisor.com. 
We also gathered the ratings breakdowns for each coffee shop to calculate the precise 5-star rating.

Next, we removed chains based on their names to focus on independent establishments.

Afterward, we calculated the weighted average score across all independent coffee shops in each city.

Finally, we ranked the data.

The data was collected in September 2024.

The results of this research, along with visualizations, are presented on the following webpage:
