The aim of this project is to identify the U.S. States and Cities that Pay the Biggest Premium for Car Repairs.
To complete this project we used a 2021 Honda Accord as an example. By scraping the price per city for various 
car repairs ('Brake Pad Replacement', 'Water Pump Replacement', 'Spark Plug Replacement', 'Alternator Replacement', 
'Starter Replacement', 'Door Mirror Replacement', 'Battery Replacement', 'AC Recharge and Leak Inspection', '7,500-mile service', 
'Tire Balancing') from https://repairpal.com/estimator/, we aimed to understand the variations in repair costs.

Initially, we gathered data on car repairs for 258 major cities across the US. 
Subsequently, we calculated the average price for each repair in each state and city, along with the national average price. 
Following that, we computed the price premium (%) paid for repairs in each city and state compared to the national average, 
and ranked the data accordingly.

Please note that the provided data is accurate as of November 2023.
