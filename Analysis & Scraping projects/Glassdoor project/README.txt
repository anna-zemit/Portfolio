The aim of this project was to identify the companies where employee confidence is highest and lowest.

To complete the project we scraped the general Top 100 companies list along with the top tech giants in the USA 
from companiesmarketcap.com. In total, our dataframe included 105 unique companies.

Next, for each company, we scraped Glassdoor employee reviews, filtering the location of reviewers to the United States 
and focusing on the most recent 2 years of reviews per company. Altogether, we scraped 198,617 reviews.

Following that, we ranked companies overall and per industry based on the percentage of employees with a positive business outlook. 
Finally, we ranked companies based on having the biggest difference (year-on-year) in the percentage of employees with a positive 
business outlook.
