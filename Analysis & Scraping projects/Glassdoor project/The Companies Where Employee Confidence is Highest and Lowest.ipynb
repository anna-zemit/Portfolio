There is also a culture of fear- our PM would tell our team that if we don't ship fast, we are all going to get laid off.\\nWeak and ineffective eng management- did absolutely nothing to address problems and like other reviews have mentioned, any complaints to HR results in a PIP. HR does not care about you or the toxic environment, they will protect your manager. I regularly had things made up about me that were easily refuted by slack conversations and work item comments. No one cares. Your manager can and will destroy you if it furthers their own career. Asking questions is seen as insubordination and will get you fired. As others have pointed out, not a safe place for women who want to further their career. If you are early in your career and ok with working nights and weekend because you are told your product is necessary, only to ship it and have it not sold, this place is for you.\\nThe tech stack is old and can be frustrating at times.

Benefits are very good (excellent insurance, fertility benefits, pay off your student loans, pay you to exercise, etc).\",\"prosOriginal\":null,\"ratingBusinessOutlook\":\"POSITIVE\",\"ratingCareerOpportunities\":5,\"ratingCeo\":\"APPROVE\",\"ratingCompensationAndBenefits\":5,\"ratingCultureAndValues\":5,\"ratingDiversityAndInclusion\":5,\"ratingOverall\":4,\"ratingRecommendToFriend\":\"POSITIVE\",\"ratingSeniorLeadership\":5,\"ratingWorkLifeBalance\":5,\"reviewDateTime\":\"2023-12-14T07:44:04.847\",\"reviewId\":82597652,\"summary\":\"Fun teams, stable company, diversity supported\",\"summaryOriginal\":null,\"translationMethod\":null,\"__typename\":\"EmployerReviewRG\"},{\"advice\":\"Share the wealth \",\"adviceOriginal\":null,\"cons\":\"Low RSU, hard to progress\",\"consOriginal\":null,\"countHelpful\":0,\"countNotHelpful\":0,\"employer\":{\"id\":1557,\"largeLogoUrl\":\"https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/1557/kla-tencor-squarelogo-1547126498959.png\",\"regularLogoUrl\":\"https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/1557/kla-tencor-squarelogo-1547126498959.png\",\"shortName\":\"KLA\",\"__typename\":\"Employer\"},\"employerResponses\":[],\"employmentStatus\":\"REGULAR\",\"featured\":false,\"isCurrentJob\":false,\"jobTitle\":{\"id\":6359650,\"text\":\"Sr. Supply chain engineer\",\"__typename\":\"JobTitle\"},\"languageId\":\"eng\",\"lengthOfEmployment\":9,\"location\":{\"id\":1147428,\"type\":\"CITY\",\"name\":\"Milpitas, CA\",\"__typename\":\"City\"},\"originalLanguageId\":null,\"pros\":\"Great technology, people, financially sound\",\"prosOriginal\":null,\"ratingBusinessOutlook\":\"POSITIVE\",\"ratingCareerOpportunities\":5,\"ratingCeo\":\"APPROVE\",\"ratingCompensationAndBenefits\":4,\"ratingCultureAndValues\":5,\"ratingDiversityAndInclusion\":3,\"ratingOverall\":5,\"ratingRecommendToFriend\":\"POSITIVE\",\"ratingSeniorLeadership\":5,\"ratingWorkLifeBalance\":4,\"reviewDateTime\":\"2023-12-06T22:01:10.310\",\"reviewId\":82395412,\"summary\":\"Good place to work\",\"summaryOriginal\":null,\"translationMethod\":null,\"__typename\":\"EmployerReviewRG\"},{\"advice\":null,\"adviceOriginal\":null,\"cons\":\"Boise not paid as much as other areas\",\"consOriginal\":null,\"countHelpful\":0,\"countNotHelpful\":0,\"employer\":{\"id\":1557,\"largeLogoUrl\":\"https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/1557/kla-tencor-squarelogo-1547126498959.png\",\"regularLogoUrl\":\"https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/1557/kla-tencor-squarelogo-1547126498959.png\",\"shortName\":\"KLA\",\"__typename\":\"Employer\"},\"employerResponses\":[],\"employmentStatus\":\"REGULAR\",\"featured\":false,\"isCurrentJob\":true,\"jobTitle\":{\"id\":8954,\"text\":\"Applications Engineer\",\"__typename\":\"JobTitle\"},\"languageId\":\"eng\",\"lengthOfEmployment\":0,\"location\":{\"id\":1127927,\"type\":\"CITY\",\"name\":\"Boise, ID\",\"__typename\":\"City\"},\"originalLanguageId\":null,\"pros\":\"Freedom to work, good benefits\",\"prosOriginal\":null,\"ratingBusinessOutlook\":\"POSITIVE\",\"ratingCareerOpportunities\":2,\"ratingCeo\":\"NO_OPINION\",\"ratingCompensationAndBenefits\":5,\"ratingCultureAndValues\":3,\"ratingDiversityAndInclusion\":3,\"ratingOverall\":3,\"ratingRecommendToFriend\":\"POSITIVE\",\"ratingSeniorLeadership\":3,\"ratingWorkLifeBalance\":5,\"reviewDateTime\":\"2023-12-01T19:01:26.087\",\"reviewId\":82256192,\"summary\":\"Current Employee works with Micron\",\"summaryOriginal\":null,\"translationMethod\":null,\"__typename\":\"EmployerReviewRG\"},{\"advice\":\"Increase stocks and lower the domain knowledge for algo engineers.\",\"adviceOriginal\":null,\"cons\":\"The pay is far lower.

They don't even know what to ask. For that they need some knowledge which they don't have. 4) Worst place if you really want to learn or do something in life. Worst work culture.

TOO MANY MEETINGS.\\r\\nKLA has way too many meetings. Such a Waste of company's time. Sometimes there are meetings about meetings. I sometimes wonder, between Meetings, Lunch hours, GYM and long hours of wasteful conversations in the break rooms how some people get work done! I found the answer, they do not! Which goes to my second Cons below\\r\\n\\r\\nBad Habits: There are two types of people at this company: \\r\\nThe Doers: these are the people that actually get work done and in my opinion are the bread and butter of the company. These are valuable technicians and engineers with good ideas who proactively and enthusiastically accomplish their tasks.\\r\\nThen there are those  (mostly engineers with some seniority) who do 1 thing and ONE thing only; perhaps it is a board they designed long ago or some other critical device they pushed from generation to generation which company is stuck with it, because the high level managers are afraid they be taking a risk of selecting new approaches. \\r\\nThese people are closed minded, lazy, and generally watch they clock all day to leave early, and run away. If you ask them to help you with anything not related to their work, they will blow you off. If an issue occurs that requires their attention, they first try to blame others and run away from the issue. Unfortunately, this mentality exists among many engineers in this company. This puts a burden on the rest of the hard working employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttitude:\\r\\n   I guess no matter where you work, you will find people with attitude. It is unfortunate that some divisions within KLA-TENCOR attracts more people with attitude than others.\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement: \\r\\nNOT GOOD! Period. All they think is ($$$) \\r\\nWith all do respect to many of the people I work with who are managers, many of which I know personally, their management skills is Zilch, Nada, nonexistent. Despite companies management roadmap and training, it boils down to individual human beliefs and attitude. What I see from most managers is the attitude of saving their own A$$ and forcing their employees to follow irrational and reactive decisions all the time. Some managers put a damp on your enthusiasm for learning, critical thinking and out of the box thinking only because they are not like that and of course they do not want you to shine. \\r\\n\\r\\nEmail:\\r\\nthere are so many emails that it sometimes gets overwhelming. Your boss could be a cube or two away, yet for simplest questions or information, He/She would rather sit in his fat chair and email. This attitude is prevalent all over the company. It is worst for some than others, but I am sure if the company did some sort of analysis of email usage and correlate that to the time wasted answering all sorts of useless emails, they would be saving millions!$$\",\"consOriginal\":null,\"countHelpful\":2,\"countNotHelpful\":0,\"employer\":{\"id\":1557,\"largeLogoUrl\":\"https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/1557/kla-tencor-squarelogo-1547126498959.png\",\"regularLogoUrl\":\"https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/1557/kla-tencor-squarelogo-1547126498959.png\",\"shortName\":\"KLA\",\"__typename\":\"Employer\"},\"employerResponses\":[],\"employmentStatus\":\"REGULAR\",\"featured\":false,\"isCurrentJob\":true,\"jobTitle\":{\"id\":4279,\"text\":\"Software Engineer\",\"__typename\":\"JobTitle\"},\"languageId\":\"eng\",\"lengthOfEmployment\":9,\"location\":{\"id\":1147428,\"type\":\"CITY\",\"name\":\"Milpitas, CA\",\"__typename\":\"City\"},\"originalLanguageId\":null,\"pros\":\"I have worked for KLA-TENCOR for almost a decade. They recruited me fresh from school. Initially I loved how they threw new projects at me with tough deadlines, I strive for that; however, soon I found that my life was turning into 7a.m-7p.m.  12 hour shifts just to get work done\\r\\n\\r\\nLearning: Company encourages you to expand your horizon, learn, and even get a higher degree while supporting you. You can theoretical attend trainings, and learn new things.\\r\\nI was lucky initially in my career that my original manager fully supported that attitude; however, it has been many years that my manager has changed and my new manager is fully against it! (Not sure why!) He feels it is a matter of waste. It is so sad. However, most reasonable managers I have met, they encourage their employees to  learn (keep up to date) and company certainly provides many means of support for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology: you do Work with the latest technology and technological ideas. I have had the best systems and top of the line equipments at my disposal. You get to play with really neat stuff. there is a always a new challenge waiting for you another the corner\\r\\n\\r\\nCompensation: Among the high tech companies of its size, KLA-TENCOR offers reasonable salaries and compensations. Annual raise is almost guaranteed as long as you perform well and have a good relationship with your manager. There used to be BIG Bonuses and very good Stock Options, all of which has been disappearing through years. Company tries to lift the workers spirit by providing occasional outings, and Holiday activities. \\r\\n\\r\\nFriendly people: Generally, Most people are nice and friendly. wherever you end up working, you will get to know your peer well. Interactions are mostly friendly and courteous, however, that could turn into disarray when Project deadlines approach, or escalations fall into your lap. Be ready for unreasonable demands, and unwise decisions being made by your superiors!\\r\\n\\r\\nHealth and Wellness: Company puts emphasize on individual's health and well-being, possibly to get better deal with insurance companies and save money, none the less the reason, it is good for employees. There is a GYM, volleyball court, Basketball court and a Bocce Ball court (yes :) Some people bike to work. The CEO (Rick Wallace at the moment) has been seen watching the Basketball games enthusiastically. He is also an avid Biker and keep in shape which is a good example for the employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraveling: If you are in the Global Support, field or application Engineer, you get to work with the customer more closely, This means you will be traveling to some exotic locations. My experience has been that If I had to travel, it had always been for a difficult reason and I end up working long hours and under stressful conditions, however, I know many colleagues to come up with various non-sense reasons to just take that next hop to over seas and rack up their mileage. Company has a generous selection of options for travel (hotels and all your expenses will be paid). I am just sad to hear that some colleagues abuse this too much.

As a result, the company is going downhill fast. So the CEO ordered the CIO to cut costs. CIO responds by outsourcing IT as much as possible. Now there is nothing wrong with this, since the company has to cut costs in order to survive. Many people have a problem with outsourcing, but cost cuts can make the difference between having and not having a job. Some blame the CEO, but seriously what can he do? His jobs is to keep the company running, he couldn’t care less about IT and the problems. As long as the CIO delivers the cost cuts, no problems. \\r\\nProblem #2: Yes I do agree that many in IT management from the CIO, the directors, to the middle managers are all terrible, but seriously how can KLA-Tencor legally get rid of them? Those people are essentially watching over a ship that is slowly sinking. As long as they do the bare minimum, they don’t have to worry and get paid a high salary. They are doing what they are told, and they lie to make it look like they are working hard. So legally KLA-Tencor cannot fire or dismiss any of them with any cause.  Further anyone who sees the problems and challenges them are forced out or shouted down. \\r\\nProblem #3: IT management is struggling with addressing ethics violations. This is hilarious since IT management are the ones who are committing the ethics violations. So since they stay, the ethics problems continue. \\r\\nProblem #4: KLA-Tencor does not care about IT workers. If they want to outsource to save money, fine, but do an orderly transition to help existing IT staff. \\r\\nProblem #5: KLA-Tencor is old, very hierarchical, and very institutional. As a result, promotions and advancement are based on seniority, not ability or capability. Example: Person A who knows jack with 10+ years working at KLA will be promoted to management much faster than Person B who knows more with 2 years working at KLA. So those who are in IT management have been with the company for 10-20 years are going to stay, ain’t nothing can be done about it. \\r\\nProblem #6: CIO has no IT management experience or ability. He ran product operations and marketing. Hence why IT at KLA-Tencor has been a train wreck. Many will question why the CEO appointed such a person to be CIO? During the re-orgs, KLA-Tencor had to cut costs, so they just consolidated departments and gave responsibility over IT and other departments to someone based on seniority in the corporate hierarchy. To the CEO, this guy’s been with the company almost 20+ years, that matters more. Who cares if he doesn’t know anything about IT? \\r\\n\\r\\nAdvice to anyone considering working in IT at KLA-Tencor: Don’t. \\r\\nYour experience and abilities will not be valued, IT management will not care to help your career, and your career growth will be limited. IT management at KLA-Tencor is a communist dictatorship. IT management will not tolerant anyone who questions them and recommends solutions. Solutions and changes cost money and KLA-Tencor does not have much money to spend on IT. Their main focus is survival. As a result, backstabbing, lies, sabotage, are rampant. Your best bet is to work at ANY company other than KLA-Tencor. Your career will shine and grow faster and you’ll be happier for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvice to those who continue to work in IT at KLA-Tencor:\\r\\n#1: Don’t expect any changes. If you look at the big picture, the company can’t afford any changes that you would like and no one cares to disrupt how things are. Seriously why would anyone in IT management listen to you and risk losing their job? They have more incentive to say and do nothing. IT management is there to help themselves, not help you. \\r\\n#2: KLA-Tencor is outsourcing IT at an accelerated rate. You are lucky to have a job. If you don’t like it, then leave. IT management is telling their staff the same message. Besides with the economy doing better, finding better jobs at better companies is much easier.\\r\\n#3: IT management is very poor. Most of them have no clue about IT and how to use it strategically. So why are they there? Simply they do what obedient slaves do in a communist dictatorship, they don’t say or do anything. To them it is better to save themselves and watch the company go down. In short: KLA-Tencor DOES NOT CARE. If you tell management that the building is on fire, it is so much easier for them to tell you to shut up.\",\"consOriginal\":null,\"countHelpful\":7,\"countNotHelpful\":0,\"employer\":{\"id\":1557,\"largeLogoUrl\":\"https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/1557/kla-tencor-squarelogo-1547126498959.png\",\"regularLogoUrl\":\"https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/1557/kla-tencor-squarelogo-1547126498959.png\",\"shortName\":\"KLA\",\"__typename\":\"Employer\"},\"employerResponses\":[],\"employmentStatus\":\"REGULAR\",\"featured\":false,\"isCurrentJob\":false,\"jobTitle\":{\"id\":10404,\"text\":\"IT Manager\",\"__typename\":\"JobTitle\"},\"languageId\":\"eng\",\"lengthOfEmployment\":6,\"location\":{\"id\":1147428,\"type\":\"CITY\",\"name\":\"Milpitas, CA\",\"__typename\":\"City\"},\"originalLanguageId\":null,\"pros\":\"None that I can see\",\"prosOriginal\":null,\"ratingBusinessOutlook\":\"NEGATIVE\",\"ratingCareerOpportunities\":1,\"ratingCeo\":\"DISAPPROVE\",\"ratingCompensationAndBenefits\":1,\"ratingCultureAndValues\":1,\"ratingDiversityAndInclusion\":0,\"ratingOverall\":1,\"ratingRecommendToFriend\":\"NEGATIVE\",\"ratingSeniorLeadership\":1,\"ratingWorkLifeBalance\":1,\"reviewDateTime\":\"2013-09-10T22:10:32.113\",\"reviewId\":3037873,\"summary\":\"Work ANYWHERE but here\",\"summaryOriginal\":null,\"translationMethod\":null,\"__typename\":\"EmployerReviewRG\"},{\"advice\":\"It's not training that's needed, the really poor lower level IT managers need to shipped out.
